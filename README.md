Before you start, if you are continuing production and some parts have
been done so far, or you have measured BTB cycle already you may provide
these information to get more accurate estimates right away. However it
is entirely optional, and program will run statistics normally even
without these data, you may acquire better results and have more
options, providing some of it.
